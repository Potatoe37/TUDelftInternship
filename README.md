# TUDelft Internship

This repository contains the programs I implemented during my Master internship in TU Delft under the supervision of Robbert Fokkink, about *A Search Game with Booby Traps* (see the [report]http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jeremy.petithomme/pro/Files/Internship_Report_M1.pdf)). These programs helped me to find some conjetures and allowed me to check them on multiple examples.

The first program concerns the case of the game with n=k-2. The second program concerns the variation of the game.
